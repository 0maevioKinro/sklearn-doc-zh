In this article, we will highlight some of the key features and benefits of Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2, such as:
 
- Linked Cp curves
- Improved SZL server
- Enhanced PLOT3D loader
- Updated ROMS loader
- And more!

## Linked Cp Curves
 
One of the most requested features by Tecplot 360 users is the ability to link slices between 3D and XY plots. This allows you to easily compare pressure coefficients (Cp) along different sections of your geometry, such as airfoils, wings, or blades.
 
Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2 introduces linked Cp curves, which let you create slices on a 3D plot and automatically generate corresponding XY plots with Cp values. You can also link existing slices and XY plots, or unlink them if needed. You can customize the appearance and layout of the linked plots, as well as export them as images or animations.
 
To learn how to use linked Cp curves in Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2, watch this short instructional video[^2^]:

## Improved SZL Server
 
The SZL server is a feature that allows you to load remote data from a server to your local machine, without transferring the entire data file. This can save you time and bandwidth when working with large CFD data sets.
 
Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2 improves the performance and stability of the SZL server, as well as adds support for more data formats, such as CGNS, Fluent HDF5, OpenFOAM, PLOT3D, and Tecplot binary. You can also use the SZL server with PyTecplot, the Python API for Tecplot 360.
 
To use the SZL server in Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2, you need to install it on your server machine and configure it according to your network settings. You can then access your remote data from Tecplot 360 using the File > Load Remote Data... menu option.
 
For more information on how to install and use the SZL server in Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2, refer to this documentation[^1^].
  
## Enhanced PLOT3D Loader
 
PLOT3D is a standard format for storing CFD data from various solvers. Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2 enhances its PLOT3D loader to support more features and fix some issues.
 
Some of the improvements in the PLOT3D loader are:

- Support for solution time in function files and FVBND files
- Support for multi-block structured grids with different IJK dimensions
- Support for loading multiple function files at once
- Support for loading function files without grid files
- Better handling of missing or corrupted data

## Updated ROMS Loader
 
The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is a widely used ocean circulation model that produces large and complex data sets. Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2 updates its ROMS loader to fix an issue with incorrect V-Velocity values for K planes greater than one.
 
The ROMS loader is included in the installation of Tecplot 360 EX 2015 R2, but it must be manually added to the tecplot.add file. To do so, follow these steps:
